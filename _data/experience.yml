    aeris is a global company that manufactures and sells air purifiers. At the beginning, I was in charge of the revamp of our websites aeris.cn / aeris.ch.
    My role then evolved to maintaining our backend APIs, mostly coded in Golang, as well as our 2 cloud infrastrutures hosted by Google Cloud for the western countries
    and QingCloud, in China. I learned to manage Kubernetes and I am in charge of the smooth deployments of your projects

    IQAir is swiss multinational that sells air purifiers in witch I worked in the air monitoring department. Our team goals were to make sure our pollution datas from
    thousands of stations were accurate and updated in our Nodejs APIs and MongoDB databases.
    I was also in charge of the implementation of the IFTTT functions related to the air monitor device that the company sells.
